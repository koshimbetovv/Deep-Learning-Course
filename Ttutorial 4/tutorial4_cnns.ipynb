        "\n",
        "The **convolution operation** is the process of implying a combination of two functions that produce the third function as a result, employing **filters** across the entire input image allows the filter to discover that **feature** of the image. Which is also called a feature map.\n",
        "In deep learning, we call these filters **kernel**. Kernel is a 1d/2d/3d structure that is *put* on top of the input to compute and extract the features of the area that it was put on.\n",

        "A kernel always start at the top-left corner of the input, and moves always from left to right, and top to bottom. **Stride** defines how many steps the kernel takes between each computation. **Kernel size** defines the size (height, width and possibly depth) of a kernel. For example, if we set kernel_size to be (3, 3), then we will have a 2d 3x3 kernel.\n",

        "When we apply a kernel to the input for feature extraction, we start from the top left and place the kernel to the edges of the input accordingly. Then, **weights** of the kernel get multiplied by the input values in the corresponding locations, and get summed to produce the **feature** that will be the output corresponding to the centre location of the kernel. You might think of this as a way to use the neightbouring values of the centre value to extract its feature.\n",

        "If we do the operation this way, you can realize that because of the starting position of the kernel and the way the convolution operation is defined, output will be smaller in size than the input, as we will not have outputs that correspond to the edges. In order to mitigate this, we use **padding**, which is basically putting dummy values to the edges in order to expand the input, so we can put the kernel in a correct way to extract the features in the edges.\n",

        "**Channels**\n",
        "\n",
        "Until this point, we assumed that the input would have a single channel, but as you know, most inputs have more channels, such as the RGB images with 3 channels, or latents with possibly higher number of channels. If the input has more than one channel, we expand the convolution operation to be applied to all channels. For example, in our 3x3 kernel case, if the input has 1 channel, we would first apply the kernel to a 3x3 = 9 top left positions in our very first convolution operation. But if the input 3 channels as in the case of RGB images, then we would apply the kernel to the top 3x3 positions of **each** channel, then sum all the values to extract the feature of a **single** output position. In this case, we would have (3x3) * 3 = 27 multiplications in our sum for a single output position. It can be seen that this convolution layer with the 3x3 kernel would map the input from a shape of 3xHxW to an output of shape HxW. **However** in such a case, the number of kernels equals to the number of input channels. Meaning that instead of passing the same 3x3 kernel through all of the channels, we pass a seperate kernel through channel 1, a seperate kernel through channel 2, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we learnt in linear layers, in most deep learning models, we want to first expand the channels of the input data in hidden layers, in order to have more weights, and therefore more representation capability. This applies to convolutional layers as well. We can use multiple kernels in a convolutional layer to expand the channels of the input. For example, if we used 4 kernels in a single conv. layer in our previous RGB image example, each kernel would apply to the whole input data **seperately**, creating an output of 4xHxW. You can imagine this as using the first kernel to get an output of HxW, and then using the second kernel to again get an output of HxW, and so on, combining these HxW outputs to a single \"3d\" output.\n",

        "As we shown in the visual example of the convolution operation, kernels have values in each of their positions. These values make the weights of the convolutional layers, and thus get updated in every training step accordingly. One can see that as we pass the kernel through the whole input data and do the calculations that will lead us to gradients, kernel is affected by all of the input data, instead of just a single partition of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Number of weights in a convolutional layer is dependent on the kernel size, number of input channels and number of output channels. For example, if the input has 3 channels, we want the output to have 1 channel, and the kernel is 3x3, then we would have 3 seperate 3x3 kernels in this layer, making our learnable weight count 3x3x3=27. But, if we want the output to have 5 channels, it can be easily inferred that this time, we will have 3 seperate 3x3 kernels for **each** output channel. Thus, the total weight count will be 5*(3x3x3) = 135. Regardless of the number of input channels and kernel size, we always have a **single bias term per each output channel**.\n",

        "\n",
        "A dilation rate of `1` corresponds to a normal convolution, while higher dilation rates spread out the kernel elements.  \n",

        "torch.nn has these convolutional layers just like the Linear layers discussed in earlier weeks. These convolutional layers are t**orch.nn.Conv1d, torch.nn.Conv2d and torch.nn.Conv3d**. Conv2d is the most used layer as it is the to-go approach in most image related tasks, and thus, we will be using it today for our CNN. However note that, we could also use Conv1d if we wanted, as for example doing 1d convolution with a kernel size of 3 is the same as doing 2d convolution with a kernel size of 3x1.\n",

        "**Max Pooling** is a pooling operation that calculates the maximum value for patches of a feature map, and uses it to create a downsampled (pooled) feature map. It is usually used after a convolutional layer. It adds a small amount of translation invariance - meaning translating the image by a small amount does not significantly affect the values of most pooled outputs.\n",
